# ColorSyncHelpers

This is a wrapper around ColorSync's newer APIs released in 10.7.

**Note:** The new ColorSync APIs do *not* have documentation in Xcode: a lot of the documentation is only in the headers. For instance, I do not know what the error domains/codes are that they return (and thus, thrown).
